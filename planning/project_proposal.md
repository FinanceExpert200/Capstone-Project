## Related Work

There are several similar apps and websites in the realm of investment education and virtual trading. Some popular examples include Investopedia, TradingView, and TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim platform. However, our project aims to stand out from these other websites in a few key ways. Firstly, we prioritize creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface that simplifies complex investment concepts and makes them accessible to a wide range of users, including beginners. We strive to provide a seamless and engaging learning experience through showcasing profitable trading strategies and showing that trading can be approached in a more mathematical way. By demonstrating that trading can be approached from a quantitative standpoint, we aim to dispel the notion that it is solely based on luck or guesswork.



## Open Questions


One important question we have is what will be the best finance api to use to best fit our needs, and how we will make our application run every day on its own. 
Some topics that we will need to research are profitable trading strategies and which market each trading strategy will be most effective.
