## Problem Statement

The stock market is known to be a direct way to build up your financial state in life, if one plays the right cards. Multiple strategies have been developed to secure a safe investment during these trading periods. Without a simulated trading account, users are unable to practice risk-free and improve their trading skills. This platform needs to implement a better educational background of these strategies that can invoke old trading partners and new trading partners into the market. To address these limitations, this website offers a simulated trading account for users to gain knowledge, make informed decisions, and personalize their trading experience.
