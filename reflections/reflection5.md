## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
It was good
* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
We added too many features at first so we belive making a plan that alowas us to make sure the features are fully fleashed out
* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
All the labs were helpful especially how to set up the backend. 

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

Everyone was helpful!
