## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to succesfully finish the MVP of the website


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We faced some sturggles with creating the automated trading bots. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)


Yes, fortunately, we were able to complete all the goals that we had planned for the week. We do not need to carry anything over. 
 
* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

For the most part, our features were distinct so we did not really need much support. We used google for any help that we need.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We do not consider any of our things at risk currently. Everything is going by well.
